Colors

Color schemes are heavily based on the [Android Color Swatches](http://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html). The color contrast ratio is measured with the help of a neat little [tool](http://leaverou.github.com/contrast-ratio/) made by [Lea Varou](http://lea.verou.me/). Colors in the stylesheet are embedded in the [hsla()](http://css-tricks.com/yay-for-hsla/) format. [ColorHexa](http://www.colorhexa.com/) is always my best friend to find out the closest web safe color.
