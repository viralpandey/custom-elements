Colophon

My attempt to thank every single individual who knowingly or unknowingly contributed to the development of this website.

1. Typography

Fonts used extensively on the website are Chaparral Pro and Skolar Web. Thanks to Adobe, fonts are served via TypeKit.

2. Colors

Color schemes are based on Android Color Swatches. Color contrast ratio is tested by neat little tool (http://leaverou.github.com/contrast-ratio/) made by Lea Varou.

3. Coding Standards
