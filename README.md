Typography
----------
Primary fonts used extensively across this website are [Chaparral Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/chaparral-pro) and [Skolar Web](https://typekit.com/fonts/skolar-web) embedded by [@font-face](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-face-rule) rule and served via [Typekit](https://typekit.com/). Fallback for the primary fonts are [Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) fall under the category of [serif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) fonts. To maintain vertical rhythm, the baseline is roughly configured to [24px](http://joshnh.com/2011/08/03/how-to-set-up-a-baseline-grid/) with the help of [Em Baseline Generator](http://joshnh.com/tools/em-baseline-generator.html) developed by [Joshua Hibbert](http://joshnh.com/) and then verified by [Basehold.it](http://basehold.it/).

Colors
------
Color schemes are heavily based on the [Android Color Swatches](http://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html). The color contrast ratio is measured with the help of a neat little [tool](http://leaverou.github.com/contrast-ratio/) made by [Lea Varou](http://lea.verou.me/). Colors in the stylesheet are embedded in the [hsla()](http://css-tricks.com/yay-for-hsla/) format. [ColorHexa](http://www.colorhexa.com/) is always my best friend to find out the closest web safe color.

Framework
---------
[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) is the framework behind this website. Coding standards are based on the [NA Isobar Coding Standards](http://isobar-idev.github.io/code-standards/) and the book [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/) by [Mark Pilgrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim_(software_developer) has always been a source of inpiration for me.

Images
------
All the images are individually smushed using [Smush.it](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/) and sprited using the [SpritePad](http://spritepad.wearekiss.com/) and then compressed again. The SVG Icons are brought to you by [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/) and the logo for personal branding is done by [Abhjijeet Wankehede](http://www.sokratus.in/). Images and SVG Icons are embedded directly via CSS using base64 encoded Data-URI generated using [Image to Data URI Converter](http://websemantics.co.uk/online_tools/image_to_data_uri_convertor/) by [Web Semantics](http://websemantics.co.uk).

Stylesheet
----------
CSS code is formatted is using [ProCSSor](http://procssor.com/) and compressed using the [Online YUI Compressor](http://refresh-sf.com/yui/).

[Helium-css](https://github.com/geuis/helium-css) has been extensivley used to churn out the unused css across pages.
