Colophon
========

My attempt to thank every single individual who knowingly or unknowingly contributed to the development of this website.

1. Typography
-------------
Fonts used extensively on the website are Chaparral Pro and Skolar Web. Thanks to Adobe, fonts are served via TypeKit. To maintain vertical rhythm, baseline is roughly configured to 38px, thanks to the Em Baseline Generator tool, developed by Joshua Hibbert and then verified by basehold.it (Thanks to _dte).

2. Colors
---------
Color schemes are based on Android Color Swatches. Color contrast ratio is tested by neat little tool (http://leaverou.github.com/contrast-ratio/) made by Lea Varou. Colors embedded in stylesheet are embedded in hsla() format. ColorHexa was used to find out the web safe colors.

3. Coding Standards
-------------------
Coding standards are based on NA Isobar Coding Standards.

4. Images
---------
Images are smushed using Smush.it and sprited using SpritePad.

5. Icons & Branding
-------------------
SVG Icons are brought to you by The Noun Project and personal branding is done by Abhjijeet Wankehede.

6. Plugins
----------
jQuery plugins from UnHeap and JavaScript libraries from JSDB.io.

7. Stylesheet
-------------
CSS code is formatted is using ProCSSor(http://procssor.com/) and compressed using Online YUI Compressor.
