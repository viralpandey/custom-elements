Colophon
========

My attempt to thank every single individual who knowingly or unknowingly contributed to the development of this website.

1. Typography
-------------
Fonts used extensively on the website are Chaparral Pro and Skolar Web. Thanks to Adobe, fonts are served via TypeKit. To maintain vertical rhythm, baseline is roughly configured to 38px, thanks to the Em Baseline Generator tool, developed by Joshua Hibbert and then verified by basehold.it (Thanks to _dte).

2. Colors
---------
Color schemes are based on Android Color Swatches. Color contrast ratio is tested by neat little tool (http://leaverou.github.com/contrast-ratio/) made by Lea Varou. Colors embedded in stylesheet are embedded in hsla() format. ColorHexa was used to find out the web safe colors.
