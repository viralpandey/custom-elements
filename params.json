Fallback for the primary fonts are [Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) fall under the category of [serif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) fonts. To maintain vertical rhythm, the baseline is roughly configured to [24px](http://joshnh.com/2011/08/03/how-to-set-up-a-baseline-grid/) with the help of [Em Baseline Generator](http://joshnh.com/tools/em-baseline-generator.html) developed by [Joshua Hibbert](http://joshnh.com/) and then verified by [Basehold.it](http://basehold.it/) and [GridWax](http://gridwax.gs/).\r\n\r\nColors\r\n------\r\nColor schemes are heavily based on the [Android Color Swatches](http://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html).
